# Return to the Void — Technical Breakdown

An open-source MOBA framework built around Epic's released Paragon assets, a modular card/tarot system, and a browser-native WebGL companion layer.

## Can Paragon be rebuilt from Epic's released assets alone?

**Short answer: no — not right out of the box.**

Epic released over $17 million worth of Paragon assets for free via the Unreal Engine Marketplace (now Fab). What they provided is the full art and audio foundation — not the game code, server architecture, or gameplay systems.

### What Epic did release

- **39+ fully rigged heroes** — Gideon, Kallari, TwinBlast, Steel, Sparrow, Boris, and more. Each includes skins, high-res textures, animation sets, VFX, and voice lines.
- **Environment packs** — 1,500+ components: foliage, architecture, lighting, and sample maps (Agora, Monolith).
- **Minions & creeps** — visual and animation models for lane and jungle units.

### What still has to be built

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| 3D Hero Models & Rigging | ✅ Released by Epic |
| Hero Animations & VFX | ✅ Released by Epic |
| Environments & Props | ✅ Released by Epic |
| Game Logic & Mechanics | ❌ Must be written — abilities, cooldowns, leveling, item shop, objectives |
| Networking & Servers | ❌ Must be written — matchmaking, client-server sync, anti-cheat |
| UI/UX | ❌ Must be written — HUD, menus, inventory, scoreboard |
| AI & Pathfinding | ❌ Must be written — minion behavior trees, tower targeting |
| Card UI / 2D Tarot Art | ❌ Must be created — custom illustration and UI frames |
| Card Engine / Deck Logic | ❌ Must be written — data tables, Blueprint mechanics |

### Has anyone built it?

Yes. Two studios have shipped games using these exact assets plus custom code:

- **Predecessor** (Omeda Studios) — built almost entirely on the released Paragon assets with custom gameplay code. Received official backing from Epic Games and launched as a full live-service game on PC and consoles.
- **Overprime** (Netmarble / Souleve) — used the assets with custom gameplay elements. Servers shut down in early 2024.

Both took years of engineering work to fill the gaps Epic left.

## Integration strategy

**[veiled-dominion-engine](https://github.com/Loptr-Lab/veiled-dominion-engine)** handles the web layer — deck builder, hero lore viewer, and rapid prototype environment for validating game rules and card logic before porting to Unreal C++.

**Unreal Engine 5** handles the core game — character abilities via the Gameplay Ability System, Niagara VFX, network replication, and the open-source C++ architecture built for community contribution.

## Get involved — training program

This project is a **living environment** built so newcomers can find where they fit and contribute to a real production pipeline. The [Loptr-Lab/training](https://github.com/Loptr-Lab/training) repo is the hands-on entry point — a self-contained TypeScript coding exercise that maps directly onto real engine work.

### Before you start

- Read **[`THE_THRESHOLD.md`](https://github.com/Loptr-Lab/training/blob/main/THE_THRESHOLD.md)** — the world, its philosophy, and why "restraint over conquest" is the idea everything else has to serve.
- New to GitHub? Complete the **[GitHub Skills tutorial](https://learn.github.com/skills)** first — a 10-minute interactive sandbox for branching, commits, and pull requests.
- Study the core game rules well enough to explain them without notes.

### Three tracks — find where you fit

**Track A: Prototype Engineer** (~4 weeks)
TypeScript/OOP fundamentals, finite state machines, test-driven development, spatial and coordinate systems, status-effect and timed state systems. The training exercise is the centerpiece — scored entirely via Jest.

**Track B: Systems Designer** (~3 weeks)
Game economy modeling, quantitative balance analysis, structured playtesting methodology. See `docs/design/GDD.md` in the engine repo.

**Track C: Technical Artist** (~2–3 weeks)
Shader programming for the engine's signature visual effects built against real accessibility constraints. See `docs/ENGINE_ACCESSIBILITY_A11Y_PARADOX.md` in the engine repo.

### VRS / vocational rehabilitation

This training program is supported under MN Vocational Rehabilitation Services (VRS) and compatible with state workforce agency funding. Under Title I of the Rehabilitation Act, all state VR agencies cover tech/IT training if it supports competitive integrated employment goals. Use the [Interactive State Agency & Voc-Rehab Lookup Tool](https://loptr-lab.github.io/training/state-resources.html) to find your state's intake links and funding availability.
